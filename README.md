  <strong>LLMs4OL: The Large Language Models for Ontology Learning Challenge</strong>
</p>



Welcome to the official repository for the **LLMs4OL (Large Language Models for Ontology Learning) challenge**, a shared task series organized as part of the International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC).

This repository serves as the central hub for datasets, tasks, documentation, and other materials used across different editions of the challenge. The LLMs4OL challenge explores the use of large language models in automating ontology learning.
